# Project One - Band project
This project is for the purpose of a band called The Monkees, they requested that they wanted a website with some information about them, such as images, clips, about us and a contact page.

The project servers as a purpose for the user to find all the material they need about The Monkees, if they wish to contact The Monkees representatives they can submit a form to get in touch. The website is also responsive and can be used on all mobile devices.

# UX
The wireframe is located here: https://github.com/GameRockUK/projectone/blob/master/Wireframe/wireframeprojectonehomepage.png

The only wireframe created was for the homepage, once we built the homepage that then set the theme for the rest of the website so I chose not to create additional wireframes.

The reason why we chose the layout above is because we wanted the site to be simplistic, we didn't want there to be lots of objects on-scree, we just wanted a website with easy accessible information.

# Testing

This project has been heavily tested using the inspection tool within Google Chrome, this was used to inspect the front end design and to test the responsivness of the code.

The contact form does not current function due to the fact that there was no e-mail address supplied by the requester, however we can set this up at a later date.

The testing for each page, went like this:

We previewed the code within the browser (Google Chrome)
We then tested the code on various resolutions using the Google Chrome inspect tool
If testing went well, then we commit to the git. If testing brought up errors then we resolve the errors and repeat the above test before comitting to the git.
Deployment
There are no differences between the development version and the release version. To release the project we pushed the git from c9.io to Github.com via the command line.

# Technologies Used

The technologies used are:

Bootstrap framework (http://www.getbootstrap.com)
HTML/CSS
Google Chrome

## Code Snippets Used
We imported some code from W3schools for the audio clips and then adjusted the audio code to find the files in the folders. This worked perfectly for the purpose of the project.

We used Bootstrap so the navigation bar has certain styles implemented by the Boostrap framework, this really helped shape the website we set out to deliver for the project. We also used the Jumbotron which is a pre-defined style from Bootstrap which helped shape the content on the pages.
